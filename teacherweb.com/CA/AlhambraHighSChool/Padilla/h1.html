alreadydone so. Do not even think of handwriting it. Go to links and look 
at the Youtube video of Plato's allegory - What is the message? In "My 
Perspectives"
Vol. 1 text, read pgs 6-9 and complete the activities (quickwrite, etc.) - 
you
will need to bring that in tomorrow. For those of you who owe me a Native
American myth story, make sure that you turn that in tomorrow as well.

30 - Work on your draft outline for IA tomorrow - you can use the Claim 
form I passed and is under "handouts" or the other outline format under 
"handouts".  Finish bibliography.

29 - Make an outline of your argument that addresses the prompt for the 
interim assessment: it asks you to state and defend a position on the 
value of sleep in our society. Gather the information that you have 
researched so far and think about what we have discussed in class and what 
you have read and seen (e.g. Ted talks video on sleep). There are two ways 
that you can format them. Both are under "Handouts" - one is just a 
generic outline format and one says "Developing your Claim" (the second 
may be more helpful). Just pick one that works for you and bring to class 
tomorrow. Just do as much as you can.

28 - Here are the vocabulary words that you need to look up and put in 
your notebook to prepare for the interim assessment.

Myriad 
Acute
Epidemic
Dogma
Cumulative
Ubiquitous
Exacerbated
Autonomy
Consolidating

Now that we have read the text of the Interim Assessment, check the 
articles that you have looked up for your Bibliography and see if you 
would look up something else and add to that.

24 - Go to links and listen to the Ted Talk on sleep - prior to watching 
it, download the question/answer sheet for this this is under "Handouts." 
Complete the answer sheet as you watch the video. Continue to work on your 
Bibliography of sources.

23 - work on researching articles on the value of sleep as we discussed in 
class. Tomorrow I would also like to share some of the stories that you 
wrote.

22 - Finalize your myth story.
 To prepare for the Interim Asseessment next week:

Start looking at research on articles related to the importance of sleep 
for adolescents. THEN after looking at the articles and various data on 
sleep, consider whether our society actually values sleep, in other words, 
if the data is clear that certain age groups need sleep and yet they are 
sleep deprived - why are they still not getting the sleep that they need? 
What is keeping societal rules or culture from accommodating the sleep 
needs of teenagers? You can cut and paste the following URL and read and 
annotate the article below. Then, for the rest of the week, find at least 
three additional articles that are related to sleep and teenagers. 
Consider the legislation that was just passed by Sen. Anthony Portantino 
to start school later. What are the repercussions? Impediments? Why don't 
we just do it?

 Read the article located at 
thihttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/opinion/sunday/rethinking-sleep.html?
register=googles site: cut and paste in URL




21 - Continue to work on your Native American myth stories - they are due 
Wednesday. Don't forget to put the name and a brief background of your 
tribe 
right before your story.

16 - make sure that you bring what you need to start drafting your Native 
American myth. I will have an assignment sheet that the substitute will 
pass out tomorrow. The chromebooks will be available but you must be on 
task. Because there is a substitute does not mean that phones can be out 
or any other class rules can be violated.  Coach will be here to help as 
well.

15 - If you did not finish the group work that you were doing in class, 
finish what you were discussing so that you will come to class prepared to 
share out.  Research your tribe and read a couple of their stories.

14 - Read and annotate the Native American stories that I passed out for 
audience, purpose, and main idea. Start researching a Native American 
tribe as we discussed in class today. By Thursday, you should have picked 
a tribe and read a few of their stories. They are usually quite short like 
the Coyote story. We will talk about the story you will write in class. 
DON'T FORGET THAT WE ARE MEETING IN THE BOOKROOM TOMORROW.

10 - Read over syllabus carefully; annotate for understanding - in other 
words, if there is a word you don't know then circle it; if there is a 
question, place a question mark by it. Be ready to discuss. Write two 
classroom rules down that you would like to see implemented for a enriched 
learning experience in the classroom. 

11 - Read and annotate the handout on Encounters and Foundations - pay 
particular attention to any mention of Native Americans. Be ready to 
discuss.
