if you read further ahead. Remember that as you read, you are writing down 
words that are difficult 
and any questions that you have about the story.

20 - Read Chapter 6 of TKAM, and write down any words that are difficult 
in your notebook. Continue 
to work with your group on your research project.  It is due Tuesday, 
April 26th. At this point, the

down what your 
hypothesis about Boo Radley. Then read over Strategy six and know what 
each of the rhetorical terms 
are that are listed and how to identify them when you see them in TKAM.  I 
reserved the chrome cart 
for tomorrow so you should be able to work for a short period of time on 
your research. That means 
that you need to come organized and focused and ready to know what you are 
looking for in your 
research.

11 - Hello, we don't meet again until 
Wednesday since tomorrow are periods 2, 
4, and 6. However, 
here is the homework that we discussed in 
class.  Remember that Wednesday is also a 
collab day.  
Make sure that you read Chapter 2 of TKAM 
by Wednesday. Review the next ten words 
from your 
TKAM vocab. list.  Turn in your 
Recreational Reading report by Wednesday. 
Make sure that you have 
turned in your Webquest and have that 
ready for turn in on Wednesday (there 
should be one copy per 
group but every group member should have 
a completed copy for themselves).  Pace 
yourself on your 
research project and make sure that you 
are working with team members and that 
you know what is 
expected and when. 

5 - Work on TKAM webquest.


March

21 - Review for Romeo and Juliet test on 
Acts III-V. The test will be on 
Wednesday so make sure that you complete 
your study guide and bring in any 
questions that you are struggling with 
tomorrow. You can also start 
drafting your Rec. Reading form. Remember 
that you were to complete a 
reading book of your choice to read 
outside of class. The analysis will be 
due shortly after break. We are using the 
same format as before; however, 
if you are doing a nonfiction text, go to 
handouts and get the appropriate 
form for that.  

16 - Read  "My Very Dear Sarah" letter on 
page 852. Write a short 
paragraph on who you think is 
responsible for the deaths of Romeo and 
Juliet.

14 - Finish your Romeo argument essay - 
it is due tomorrow.

9 - Work on finishing your second draft

all five paragraphs drafted up.  In the 
next couple of days, edit and 
revise. This is due on Tuesday, 
March 15.

6 - Work on 3d body paragraph of your 
Romeo argument essay. Also, make 
sure that you are complete Act IV 
questions on your study guide. 

3 -Work on your "Develop your Claim 
Sheet" and Your Thesis Machine. Gather 
the evidence that you will use and place 
it somewhere on your Claim Sheet 
so you can go right to it during your 
writing time in class. Remember that 
you will only have the time in class to 
write. You will not be able to 
take the prompt home or work on it 
another day in class.



February 

29 - Read Text #5 in your packet.

26 - Go to the Freshmen Links tab. At the 
bottom is the link for the 
youtube video that we saw today entitled 
"Be a Man."  Use this to complete 
the handout that you were 
given today in class.

25 - Look at the cartoon in the handout 
that I gave you for preparing for 
the interim assessment. On the flip side 
of the page, respond to the 
Quickwrite in the space 
provided.

19 - if you finished your third body 
paragraph, check it against the sheet 
that I gave you today. Finish Act III 
study guide questions. Finish 
questions that you were supposed to do in 
class on "Finding Meaning".

18 - Revisit your claim based on the 
comments written on your paper. You 
may just need to slightly 
revise or clarify.  After that, you will 
probably need to go back and look 
at your body paragraphs t hat 
you have written so far to make sure that 
they explain your thesis.

17 - complete the second paragraph of the 
body essay for Romeo prompt. 
Remember that each item 
is ONE sentence only. You can join two 
independent clauses to make ONE 
sentence if you need to. Do 
your best because it is a draft.

16 - Complete the first paragraph of the 
body essay for Romeo prompt. Just 
complete (as you did 
before) the six sentences that provide 
support for your claim.  Read Scene 
iii, Act III or just look it 
over for the gist of the scene. Refer to 
"No Fear Shakespeare" to help you 
out.

13 - On the handout given on the Romeo 
prompt, complete the first six 
sentences answering what is 
required for each sentence. The last is 
your claim which is the  most 
important to the paper.

11 - Read Act III, Scene i and answer 
study guide questions. Write down 
any questions that you have 
regarding Mr. Jimenez's presentation on 
your registration.

9 - Study your notes and study guides for 
Acts I and II for tomorrow's 
test on Romeo and Juliet.

2 - Mask due tomorrow. Look at your 
assignment sheet; you will be graded 
and creativity and on how 
well you explained your symbols (i.e. 
don't just put a heart and say that 
it equals love - explain how it 
relates to the character that you chose 
and you). Read next two pages of 
Act II, Scene 4.

1 - Be prepared to work on  your masks. 
If you do  not have materials, 
that is alright. You can use 
construction paper that I have in my 
room.  Be sure, however, to bring 
your sketch or mask draft.  
Also you are reading pg 774 and 775 of 
Romeo and Juliet which is the scene 
that I summarized for 
you today in class. 


January

27 - Start drafting the characteristics 
that you will use on your mask for 
both you and the character 
that you choose. Remember that you will 
be using symbols on your mask to 
represent those traits. 
You may also want to start sketching or 
looking up different types of mask 
so that when we start 
working on them in class, you will have a 
general idea of what you are 
making and how you want it to 
look.  There are sample masks attached to 
your assignment or you can look 
up other ones to choose 
from.  Remember to bring in a shoe box or 
the top of a cereal box to use 
as the base for your mask. I 
have construction paper, some ribbon (not 
much), and glitter. If you want 
to add beads, feathers, 
sequins, etc. you will need to get that.

Also don't forget to select at least two 
words from  page 733 and look 
them up. Make a chart like the 
one that we look at today in the textbook 
where it shows the word, the 
origin, what it meant 
originally and what it means now.

26 - Read Act II, Scene i from Romeo and 
Juliet.  Do not forget to use "No 
Fear Shakespeare" link if 
you are having difficulty. Remember to 
answer questions on study guide as 
you read.

25 - We have just completed reading Act I 
of Romeo and Juliet. Complete 
Questions 1-4 on page 762 
of your text.  We will work on the 
remaining questions in class. In 
addition, continue to work on your 
Act I questions on your study guide.

19 - Read the rest of scene ii (it is 
only a page and half since we did 
most in class). Answer questions 
on your multi-page study guide. It should 
help you having already done the 
first handout on Act I.

15 - catch up on any work that you did 
not do this past week. You  should 
have completed reading 
Act, scene i of Romeo and Juliet and 
completed the first handout of Act I 
distributed in class. Some of 
you did not turn in your Clippers essay. 
Your last chance is Tuesday. If 
it is not in, then you get a 
zero.

14 - Complete the single sheet of your 
Act One Study Guide handout (you 
were given two handouts 
today: one was a single sheet front to 
back and the other was a multi-page 
study guide for the whole 
play).  Just try to complete the single 
sheet handout front and back. 

12 -Write a brief summary  of what you 
read in Act I, Scene i, in  the 
Romeo and Juliet section set 
apart in your notebook. Don't forget to 
finish your Clippers essay to turn 
in tomorrow. You can print 
it out in the lab, library or Career 
Center if you don't have a printer at 
home or have other printer 
problems.

11 - Read Act I, scene i of Romeo and 
Juliet from the graphic handout that 
I gave you today in class.  
Remember that if you want to read it 
alongside modern day English, you can 
go to "Freshmen Links" 
at this site and click on No Fear 
Shakespeare.  It will take you to a site 
that shows Romeo and Juliet in 
the old English and on the other side of 
the page, it will translate into 
modern English.  Tomorrow 
you may have a sub since I will probably 
be at the district office.  It 
will be a teacher from this school. 
Please be the respectful group that you 
are.  You will probably be 
watching a documentary on 
Shakespeare's background.  You can jot 
down anything you learn from the 
video that you did not get 
in your reading.

7 - on the back of your Shakespeare 
packet, you have a small "research" 
component. Unfortunately, a 
couple of the links that are listed there 
no longer work.  I have posted 
another link here under the tab 
of "Freshmen Links." Use that link (or 
links) to answer the questions.

6 - Read the rest of packet and write 
down anything that you have 
questions about. Bring any of your 
LA Clippers drafts or notes that you may 
have.

5- Read "Elizabethan Theatre" in the 
packet that I handed out to you. 
 
4 - Write the rationale for your rating 
on the questions we did in class 
today. Also, read and annotate 
Shakespeare handout given in class. For 
tonight you only have to read up 
to Elizabethan World.


December

Study for finals.

9 - Read the poem "The Seven Ages of Man" 
by William Shakespeare and 
annotate for poetic devices.  Try to 
answer the questions 1-6.

7 - From the multi-page Poetry packet 
that I gave you that includes poems 
and assignments, read the poem "The Fury 
of Overshoes" and then answers 
questions 2-8 that 
follow.  Read the poem out loud once just 
to get a feel for it.  Then read 
it again and identify all 
the poetic devices (make sure that you 
have your handout with you to help 
you out and/or look in the 
glossary in your book). After looking at 
all the ways that a poet creates 
a message through a poem, 
write down what you think the poem means.  
Fourth period, do not forget to 
go through your Daily 
Orals and find at least two more examples 
of parallel structure that we 
previously did. Don't forget to 
work on your Clipper's writing 
assignment. You can start drafting it out 
if you haven't already.

1 - Read Introduction to poetry packet. 
Then read the poem "A Narrow 
Fellow in the Grass" by Emily 
Dickinson that is in your blue Elements 
of Literature textbook.

"The Birds."  The following 
is a list of what was identified to be

the class. Select one of the 
following climaxes that you identified as 
the climax on your plot diagram 
and support you answer 
with something from the text that made 
you believe that what you chose was 
the best choice for the 
climax.

all grade levels in your academic 
planner that Ms. Del Rio gave 
you during your presentations. She will 
pick these up on Monday.

16 - Study your academic vocabulary words 
from "Most Dangerous Game" and 
read two more pages.

This is the homework that Ms. Maya Del 
Rio gave you when she came to class 
today to talk about 
your A-G requirements.  This is due 
Thursday.
Put Ms. Padilla, 3d Period, on Agenda - 
Look at back page and identify 
website on back 
(doorways a-g website) this is the 
website given by Ms. Del Rio to do your 
homework packet that she 
gave you today in class. Your task is to 
complete the 9th grade.  You will 
be listing all classes that 
you are taking this year that fall under 
each category.  

14 - Read the next three pages of MDG, 
write down characteristics of 
Zaroff then make a Venn 
diagram.

Dangerous Game" in the reading 
packet that I gave you today

circles or boxes around words you do not 
know).  Don't forget to look at 
the front sheet that has the 
academic vocabulary and highlight or 
underline those words when you come 
to them in the story.  As 
you find out more about the character of 
Rainsford, write down those 
characteristics in your 
notebook. You can start a column with his 
name and then list the character 
traits that you find as you 
read the story.  We started doing some of 
this in class.

8 - Read the first four pages of the 
story "Most Dangerous Game" in your 
big blue Elements of Lit text 
book.

2 -  Complete your notes using the 
Developing the Claim and using an 
argument frame (that I passed 
out in class) and whatever outlines that 
you will use on your benchmark 
tomorrow.

1 -  Fill out the "Developing your Claim" 
form based on the "Why Boys 
Don't Play With Dolls" article. 
Here is the prompt that you will be 
writing on in class on Thursday. 
Basically, what it is asking is to what 
degree do you agree or not agree 
with the author who claims 
that adults are more responsible for 
girls/boys conforming (conform means 
to accept values or ideas
with you agree with them or not) to 
gender roles than the way we just 
naturally think because of
our brain chemistry.

The background for the prompt is: Despite 
a push by the Feminist Movement 
to encourage boys to 
play with dolls and girls to play with 
trucks, not much has changed with 
regard to children and their 
toys. In Katha Politt's article, "Why 
Boys Don't Play with Dolls," she 
claims that the adult world is more 
responsible than "innate brain chemistry" 
for children conforming to 
"fixed" gender roles.

Directions for prompt:  "After reading 
the text(s) on gender norms, write 
an argumentative essay that 
defends, challenges, or qualifies the 
author's claim. Be sure to develop 
your argument by  using 
evidence for the text(s).  To strengthen 
you argument, use examples from 
your reading, schoolwork, 
and/or personal experience."

Think about the discussions that we have 
had in class and the other 
articles that you have read. Just 
do the best you can and we will work on 
it in class tomorrow.

August

31 - Try to answer questions that were 
given out today on article that we 
went over in class. Do not 
worry if you don't understand all the 
words in the article, just do the 
best you can.

27 - Read article handout in class and 
answer questions under Text 2 of 
the handout given out class.

26 - Read and annotate the short story 
that I passed out in class today 
called "The Lady or the Tiger." 
Don't forget to look first at the back of 
the story where it tells you 
about the author, and has ideas 
about the story and other details.  Think 
of what you read there to help 
you annotate throughout the 
story.

25 - Finish your collage - don't forget 
to put your name on it.  Make sure 
that you have read and 
annotated the poem "Hanoi" and finish 
filling out the chart given on "The 
Sniper/Hanoi."

21 - Next week, in addition to discussing 
themes with "The Sniper" story, 
you will be making a 
collage regarding your interpretation of 
respect.  Start thinking about 
(and drafting in your notebook) 
what the word "respect" means to you. 
Don't just look it up in the 
dictionary - think about how you 
use it.  Also,  write down what your 
goals are and what success means to 
you.  Select a picture of 
yourself that best reflects you when you 
had the best time or with someone 
or doing something that 
is important to you.

20 - Finalize your paragraph on "The Sun 
Goes Down on Summer." Remember 
that when you are 
turning in your final paper they need to 
be typed.  The format is called 
MLA (you can find what this 
looks like under the Citation link that 
is listed under Freshmen Links).  
Your should double-space, 
indent 5 spaces on first line, use 12 pt. 
Times New Roman or Arial font 
and the heading of your paper 
should look like this:

First and Last Name (on left hand corner 
of paper)

Instructor's Name

Freshmen 1/2 - Period No.

20 August 2015 (remember that the date is 
written exactly this with no 
commas.



19 - Using the color coding system 
modeled in class today, take your 
reflective paragraph and 
underline 
(or highlight) your topic sentence in 
green, your evidence (concrete 
detail) in red, and your 
commentary 
on your evidence in blue. You can use 
highlighters, colored pencils, or 
different color ink to do this. 
Make sure that you read through the whole 
packet on "The Sniper" including 
the Academic Vocabulary 
and write down any questions that you 
have.

18 - Rewrite your draft paragraph on "The 
Sun Goes Down on Summer." Please 
be sure to also bring 
your first draft.


17 -  Read the poem handed out today 
entitled "The Sun Goes Down on 
Summer." Make notes in the 
margin as you read indicating what is 
familiar to you. For example, if you 
feel the same way as the 
writer, make a note on the side like "I 
agree" or "I disagree." Circle 
words that you don't understand. 
Place questions marks next to sentences 
that you are not sure about.  If 
you see a figure of speech 
that you recognize like "metaphor" or 
"simile" 

Turn over the poem and use the paragraph 
as a model for you to use to 
write your own paragraph 
about whether you relate to "The Sun Goes 
Down on Summer." This is a draft 
paragraph so you can 
either type it or write in your notebook, 
but skip lines.  This is just a 
draft.
