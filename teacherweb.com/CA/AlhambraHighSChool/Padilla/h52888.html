    <pre class="owner">TO ALL STUDENTS: AS OF DECEMBER 2017 THIS WEBSITE WILL BE CLOSED DOWN. MY 
NEW SITE WILL BE: https://sites.google.com/view/mspadilla-ahs-website/home



November 30

Sadly, last night for this website, so please take down the website name 
above. Tonight's homework is to write out the prompt that you annotated and 
did your quotation sheet on. You may use your quotation sheet for reference. 
Try not to take more than 50 minutes (treat it like a timed, rather than a 
process write), but if you need a bit more time than take it; don't take so 
long that it becomes a five page paper. Read David Sedaris essay in Lang and 
Comp "Me Talk Pretty One Day" and answer questions. Download Winter Book 
read.



27 - Study for Crucible test on Acts I and II. Make sure that you know the 
vocabulary and the close reading questions and annotations that are marked 
in 
your Perspectives book. Go through the Unit questions and comprehension 
checks. work on ism project. News. Commonplace journals will be collected 
this Friday.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Please check the portal; I have a number of students who have not been 
turning in any work or coming to see me for tutoring, etc. DO NOT COME AT 
THE 
END OF THE GRADING PERIOD AND ASK IF YOU CAN DO EXTRA CREDIT TO BRING UP 
YOUR 
GRADE IF YOU ARE NOT DOING YOUR WORK NOW. Some of you are going on field 
trips rather than coming to class and are falling behind because of it.

17 - Finish Act III of Crucible; pay attention to close reading indicators 
in 
your text and allusion; work on MC packet - try timing yourself 55 minutes, 
then stop and mark where you were at this point and then continue until you 
finish; work on ism project. Don't forget news and commonplace.


14 - Complete Exercise 2 on Appositives in your Lang and Comp book (pg 273); 
continue reading Act II and working on study guide; commonplace, news. 
Period 
2, I forgot to mention to this class that I also want a reflection paragraph 
under your individual tabs in your ism binder. You will write a short 
reflection on what you gained from doing this project - not just necessarily 
in terms of the info, but in terms of the skills, working together, etc. 
Also, a reminder - some of you ask to borrow books and then just leave them 
on top of the desks. If this continues, I will no longer let you take a book 
out SO be considerate and mindful. If you borrow (or your group or you just 
see it out close to bell) a book, put it back where it belongs before you 
leave the classroom.

13 - Look at the Concept Vocabulary at the bottom of page 597 in 
Perspectives 
and pay attention to Latin root -fama- take note of the meaning of these 
words as you continue to read Crucible. You DO NOT have to the Notebook 
assignment in terms of questions 1 & 2. On page 598 read and make sure that 
you understand Analyze Craft and Structure and on page 599, Read over 
Conventions and Style and work up to everything but the section that says 
"Write It". You do not have to do the "Write It" section. Read the first 
five 
pages of Act II.  For those of you working ahead, read up to pg 611 by 
Wednesday and finish Act II by Friday. News; commonplace; isms.

11 - Read the Student Writing section on page 501 of Lang and Comp book 
entitled Rhetorical Analysis: Analyzing a Prose Passage. Answer the 
Questions on page 503 then read through to page 506 on the essay "Dumpster 
Diving and answer the questions on page 506.  Review Grammar as Rhetoirc 
and Style on Short Simple Sentences and Fragments through 509. Exercises 
will be assigned on Monday.

7 - For clarification - Study guide questions are just that - you are to 
answer them as you read which is why I keep saying in class not to wait 
until 
the last minute. I will be checking these and you will need them to study 
for 
tests, etc. Why would you get it and not use it?  Toulmin and Precis on 
McCarthy due tomorrow. Since we did not yet get a change to review 
SOAPSTONE, 
I will collect that on Thursday. Webquest due date moved to Monday. Work 
on 
Crucible handouts, ism project, commonplace, news. Don't forget Writing 
Lab 
is tomorrow. Let me know so I can sign you up.

Why are your organizational binders still in the back of the room?

6 - Correct your Precis if you have any changes; come with your directions 
for "isms" project that you downloaded a couple of weeks ago and begin 
thinking about which literary time period your group may want to research; 
news; commonplace - Webquest and toulmin/precis/SOAPSTONE are due 
Wednesday; 
however, if you will be going to Writing Lab on Wednesday for help, I will 
move to Thursday. Enough students need to demonstrate that they will be 
going 
to writing lab.

1 - continue reading and annotating Act I of Crucible. Do not forget to 
make 
Vocabulary chart; watch news; stay on top of Commonplace journals.

October

31 - SOAPSTONE McCarthy as discussed in class; go over MC answers and 
explain why the correct answer is the only answer it can be. Read Act I of 
Crucible by Friday. Make Vocab chart as you read as demonstrated in class.

30 - Yay! tomorrow's Halloween - dress up and scare me.  Tonight go over 
your changes to MC questions. Determine why the correct answer is the ONLY 
answer it could be. Review rhetorical terms that you are unfamiliar with. 
Read pages 563 to 566 in Perspectives on The Crucible. You will stop right 
before the dialogue. News. Commonplace.

26 - Read Let Teenagers Try Adulthood on page 254 - just write down your 
thoughts - what is the point? News, commonplace.

24 - Go over the problems you had with your MC handout. For example, if 
you did not know some of the rhetorical terms, look them up. You can go 
back to the index cards that you made (remember the 5 per week?) or if 
there are some that you do not recognize from your glossary in Lang and 
Comp book go the links on Forest of Rhetoric at the links tab. On the back 
of your packet or in your notebook, just write down anything that identify 
as being a problem.

23 - Work on MC Reading handout distributed in class and Autobiographers 
and Diarists. Time yourself for 60 minutes, then stop wherever you are 
when the timer goes off. Circle where you left off, and then continue to 
answer questions. Bring your Toulmin/Precis McCarthy that you were able to 
draft and rework to class tomorrow. Second period, you had an in-class 
precis to write on Friday. Please bring to me and/or Ms. Juarez tomorrow. 
Don't forget to watch news and keep up on your commonplace journals. Come 
with any questions on the readings from Friday related to Crucible, witch 
hysteria, etc.

Period 3 - Need Shirley, Evelyn etc. group notes.

21 - sorry, site was down so I didn't get to post this yesterday, but as 
discussed in class, read and annotate handout (second Crucible article); 
look at your precis and Toulmin on McCarthy that you took yesterday to 
pair off and discuss. Be prepared for panel on Monday.


Pick up all CORRECTED work in drawer - it should stay in your binder. I 
don't know why some of the work is still in there since you should see 
what you did on it. For those of you who continue to print on "scrap" 
paper (i.e. graph or calendar paper is on back), please refrain from doing 
so. Your printed work should be on plain white paper that does not bank 
statement and/or other types of forms)

19 because of assembly and inquiring minds 
from 3d period about aphorisms and Toulmin, 
we will work on writing questions, etc. and 
move panel debate to Monday. Read witches and 
hysteria. Sorry for the recent confusion, but 
you must also learn to communicate.

18 - Read and annotate McCarthy speech. 
Answer questions briefly at bottom 
on page (you can write on that space) then 
Toulmin it and write a Precis. 
Continue to work on argument panel. News. 
Commonplace.

16 - Each group is going to have a plain 
piece of paper on their desk 
tomorrow when they come in - write your claim 
for your argument panel in a 
marker; we will then post them around the 
room and do a quick gallery walk 
so that your peers can comment on your claim; 
download and read the 
article by Arthur Miller on "Why I wrote the 
Crucible". If you do not 
print out, make sure that you have the 
download to refer to and that notes 
are made in your homework tab in your binder. 
News; commonplace journals. 
For a reference to a panel discussion, you 
may want to go online to see a 
video of "This Week with George 
Stephanpolous" - this is a Sunday 8:00 
a.m. morning program that recaps the week's 
news and then has notable 
people from different backgrounds sit at a 
"roundtable" and discuss what 
they think. This is the portion that you 
would want to watch (it is 
usually only about 5 minutes, but for 
context, you may want to watch the 
whole broadcast) The format can be something 
you may want to use when you 
do your panel discussion.

12 - Finalize Kant/Jefferson (stop saying 
that there is no "prompt". It is 
very clear at the end of the first paragraph 
how you are to develop the 
rest of the essay. Make sure all drafts are 
attache. Review Chapter 3 on 
Argument. Since you are now getting 
presentations on different 
organizational modalities, I want to make 
sure that you understand the 
structure. Look particularly at the Toulmin 
model. Also, under AP 
Handouts, download the Toulmin Model document 
and put it in your notebook 
- look at it as you are reading about the 
model. Work on panel argument 
project. Commonplace journals. News.

11 - Again, make sure that you are solid on 
your Organizational Modality 
project and ready to present; work on your 
Argument panel; finalize 
Kant/Jefferson for Friday; commonplace 
journals, news. If you did not turn 
in your aphorism, make sure that you have it 
in by tomorrow.

9 - continue to work on Organizational 
Modality (make sure you practice 
timing) and Kant/Jefferson. Go to page 126 of 
Perspectives and follow 
directions for the "Argument" panel 
discussion. For those of you who 
missed class for PSAT registration, we went 
over this so when you get 
back, your team leaders and other group 
members can explain (it is a group 
project. Kant/Jefferson due date is moved to 
Friday - make sue that you 
include all your drafts to final (this may 
mean that you will need to do a 
lot of "save as" so that I can see what 
changes that you made but you will 
not have to type everything. Commonplace 
Journals news. Some of you did 
not turn in your aphorism today(look at 
Franklin's aphorisms) and previous 
posting. Period 2, I did not collect so that 
is on me, but Period 3 should 
have known because I said I was collecting 
it. Obviously, some people are 
not checking website.

5 - Read Narrative of Fredrick (annotate of 
course) and Autobiography of 
Benjamin Franklin. Write your own aphorism on 
an index card or paper cut 
to the size of an index card. News.Project.

3 - Read Mori Education Essay under 
"Education" in English Lang and Comp. 
News. Kant/Jefferson draft. 

2 - Write a rhetorical precis on Sontag's 
Cave - this will be due on 
Wednesday. Look for an example of a precis 
and the handout (if you have 
not done it before under "AP Handouts"). You 
will find the definition of 
what goes in each sentence and samples. There 
is also a link under links 
that shows an interactive precis.  We will 
review Kant instructions again 
tomorrow since some are confused about its 
structure. Commonplace 
journals; news; Organizational Modality 
project.

September

annotate Sontag's essay 
entitled"In Plato's Cave." It is twelve pages

write your annotations in your homework 
notebook. Either way, you must 
have access to the text.

28 - Period 3 - none of you wrote down the 
team names of who is doing what 
for
the Organizational Modality project so you 
will need to let me know who is
doing what. Go to AP handouts and read and 
annotate Sontag's essay 
entitled
"In Plato's Cave." It is twelve pages so here 
are your options: you can
download and write on the copy; download on a 
reading device and write 
your
annotations in your homework notebook. Either 
way, you must have access to 
the
text. Continue to work on Kant - start 3d 
paragraph. If you want to bring 
me
what you have so far so I can see if you are 
on the right track, that is 
ok.
You may want to make logistical arrangements 
to work on Organizational
Modality project.

27 - Look at the picture on the back of the 
Allegory of the Cave that 
shows
the prisoners chained looking at the wall. 
Notice the bridge behind where 
the
bridge people would be reflecting the images 
on the wall. Draw or write on 
the
part of the paper that the chained people are 
looking at, something about 
what
you have always believed without questioning. 
Read and annotate the 
handout

and
complete exercises on pages 122 and 123. 
Complete as much of the chart as 
you
can. Onpage 124 - read and go over what 
Parallelism and Antithesis is and

commonplace.

25 - Read Baldwin's Essay on education in 
Lang and Comp book on page 197 
and answer the text questions that follow. 
Watch news and stay up on your 
commonplace journals. For those in period 2 
who got their interim 
assessments read through the rubric, prompt, 
and your response. Period 3 - 
look over Organization model handout given.

22 - Revise Chart on Everyday Use - I realize 
that Period 3 did not not 
meet today, but take a look at your chart and 
make sure that you respond 
to what is being asked and you understand it.

Download the handout on High, Middle, and Low 
language and place under 
handout tab in your binder. Download the 
Kant-Jefferson assignment and 
just DRAFT it out tonight.

11 - Disappointed while looking at 
Bibliography assignment. There was a 
lot of time to complete for homework and so 
many only have a few sources, 
some do not have the correct format, others 
scribbled their names on top. 
This is not alright and not a presentation of 
the work required in this 
class, or any class for that matter. For 
tonight, read (and that means 
closely read) Chapter 3 in Lang and Comp on 
analyzing arguments - complete 
the activity on page 86; tomorrow you will be

news; be prepared to give the example of 
biblical allusion from your 
summer assignment.

they affect the message. 
Watch news. Stay up to date on all 
assignments.

but you do not have to do the

annotate it for key ideas. 
Circle words or concepts that you do not

will spend the first part of 
the period on Sophie and then we will go over 
the questions from Modern 
Applications, Modern Approaches; Tuesday, the 
same but we will aim to go 
over the Bill of Rights/Constitution. Watch 
news.



August

31  Don't forget to turn in you Bibliography 
tomorrow if you have not 
already
done so. Do not even think of handwriting it. 
Go to links and look at the
Youtube video of Plato's allegory - What is 
the message? In "My 
Perspectives" Vol. 1 text, read pgs 6-9 and 
complete the activities 
(quickwrite, etc.) - you will need to bring 
that in tomorrow.  Watch news.

30 - Work on your draft outline for IA 
tomorrow - you can use the Claim 
form I passed and is under "handouts" or the 
other outline format under 
"handouts". Watch news. Finish bibliography.

29 - Re-Read pg 54 from Lang & Comp starting 
with "From Close Reading to 
Analysis". You may considering using the 
chart show to help break down 
Emerson's speech. After annotating the speech 
last night, now add in the 
overall effect of his speech.  For the 
interim assessment, read page 172 
"Your Brain on Video Games."  Read Emerson's 
essay "On Education" on  pgs 
185-195 in Lang and Comp. It may help you to 
understand his ideas.

28 - Read Emerson's "American Scholar" 
speech. You can find it either 
under Handouts or Links. If not, it is easy 
to google - just put in "text 
of Emerson's American Scholar Speech." 
Annotate for audience, purpose, the 
proofs (ethos, pathos, logos); any rhetorical 
terms that you have 
mastered, and any "American Values" that you 
might see identified from 
your American Values handout. Watch the news 
and jot down any event that 
you think is particularly important - you 
should be notice patterns. For 
those groups who need to go find a bit of 
additional information to 
clarify for groups, make sure that you 
understand what you will be 
explaining. Bibliographies are due Friday so 
stay on top of that.

24 - Go to links and listen to the Ted Talk 
on sleep - prior to watching 
it, download the question/answer sheet for 
this this is under "Handouts." 
Complete the answer sheet as you watch the 
video. Then download the 
article under handouts entitled "The people 
who need very little sleep," 
read and annotate for author, purpose, and 
main idea. Watch news; continue 
to work on your own bibliography. After 
reading some of these articles, it 
should help you know what to look for.

23 - continue your research on articles 
related to sleep. You will be 
giving me a bibliography so make sure that 
you have the proper cites for 
your sources. Watch news. Period 3 - based on 
our discussion on Hellenism, 
look up connections and/or examples of Stoic, 
Cynic, Epicurian, and 
neoplatonism. THANKS TO ALL OF YOU WHO 
PARTICIPATED IN WASC GROUPS TODAY! 
YOU ARE AWESOME.

22 - Start looking at research on articles 
related to the importance of 
sleep for adolescents. THEN after looking at 
the articles and various data 
on sleep, consider whether our society 
actually values sleep, in other 
words, if the data is clear that certain age 
groups need sleep and yet 
they are sleep deprived - why are they still 
not getting the sleep that 
they need? What is keeping societal rules or 
culture from accommodating 
the sleep needs of teenagers? You can cut and 
paste the following URL and 
read and annotate the article below. Then, 
for the rest of the week, find 
at least three additional articles that are 
related to sleep and 
teenagers. Consider the legislation that was 
just passed by Sen. Anthony 
Portantino to start school later. What are 
the repercussions? Impediments? 
Why don't we just do it?

Hi Folks - I need to make a correction about 
the Rules Assembly tomorrow. 
It will NOT be 3d period; it will actually be 
4th period so we can 
continue with presentations as planned. 
Please consider signing up for the 
WASC focus group meetings on Wednesday during 
collaboration. The meetings 
are over at the end of the regular school day 
--2:41 - so if you are going 
to be on campus anyway, you may want to lend 
your voice to this important 
process. Thanks Period 3 - Lots of students 
signing up. I want to remind 
you to sign up for one of the topics. Some 
have signed up for three, but 
you can't be in three places at one time 
unless you are indicating that 
over the next few meetings, you will go to 
those. 

21 - Read "Coyote Finishes his Work" which 
you can find under English 
Links (last one); it is a Native American 
story. Answer the following 
questions:

Guiding Questions
What events in the story show that Coyote is 
a trickster hero?
What becomes of Coyote?
Who is Old Man?
What is Other Side Camp?
What gender is the Earth?
What do readers learn about the lives and 
beliefs of the Nez Perce?
How can the beliefs of the Nez Perce help 
today's peoples understand the 
universe?





16 - come prepared to work tomorrow on your 
Sophie's World group 
assignment. Chromebooks will be available, 
but you will need to bring your 
Sophie's text, chart, etc.  Please stay on 
task. Read Chapter 2 in Lang 
and Comp and pay particular attention to the 
rhetorical terms listed. As 
suggested in class, master five words per 
week. You can "flash cards" from 
index cards or use Quizlet on line (a very 
good source). Do not forget to 
write down any questions you have on your 
reading. Great Job this week, 
folks! Keep it up.

15 - I just noticed that there is a missing 
couple of pages on some of the 
Chapter 2 Modern Approaches to Argument 
packet I handed out today. IF YOU 
DO 
NOT HAVE CHAPTER 2 REVIEW QUESTIONS, then you 
DON'T HAVE THE COMPLETE 
PACKET. If you are reading this while you are 
still on campus, I have left 
complete packets in the envelope on my door; 
if you are reading this from 
home, go to AP Handouts and look for the 
title of the packet (it is the 
one 
under AP Handouts. Look through it before you 
print out the whole thing - 
you may only need to print out the last two 
or three pages, but check.

Tonight, read, annotate, and answer the 
questions on Modern Approaches. By 
Thursday, complete reading all of Chapter 1 
in your Lang and Comp text 
(make 
sure to take notes in the homework notes 
section of your binder on any 
questions that you may have from that 
chapter.  WATCH national news.

14 - Read and annotate Modern Applications of 
Ancient Rhetoric; answer the 
Review questions. If you did not answer the 
questions to Brief History, 
please answer those as well and be ready to 
discuss both. Watch the 
national 
news. DON'T FORGET TO MEET AT THE BOOKROOM 
TOMORROW.

11 - Read and annotate Brief History of 
Rhetoric; there should be a sheet 
attached with questions - please respond and 
be ready to discuss on 
Monday.

10 - Read over syllabus carefully; annotate 
for understanding - in other 
words, if there is a word you don't know then 
circle it; if there is a 
question, place a question mark by it. Be 
ready to discuss. Write two 
classroom rules down that you would like to 
see implemented for a enriched 
learning experience in the classroom.
